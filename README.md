Clean Streets is a neighbor-supported, socially-minded litter removal service activating San Francisco blocks with recurring litter pickup, volunteer events, and transparent reporting.

### Contributing updates

1. Edit the static assets in `index.html` and `stylesheet.css` to reflect the latest campaign messaging.
2. Keep structured data (`application/ld+json`) current so search engines and LLMs can surface Clean Streets accurately.
3. Add or update SVG-based graphics in the `images/` directory to ensure crisp rendering across devices.

### Running tests

Install dependencies and run the automated checks before committing changes:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```
